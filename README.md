Intro:

Planter and Kitchen blocks are made functional and allows to grow and cook food respectively. 
This mod integrates with Eat.Drink.Sleep.Repeat! mod stat mechanics.
It is based on Food and Fatigue mod, by John19. Cudos to him for letting me modify and republish his mod!

How to make food in space:

Eat packaged food from the shop or drop pods to begin with.
Create some biomass in the bathroom like a proud spaceman that you are.
Use it in the Planter to grow mushrooms and apples.
Use grown products in the kitchen to cook some tasty and healthy spacemade food!
Mix in some meat from hunted wild animals if you are not into souley vegan diet.
