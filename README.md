[h1]Intro[/h1] 

This is No Script version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2570427696]Plant and Cook[/url] mod.
It is not integrated with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2547246713]Eat.Sleep.Drink.Repeat![/url] stats mechanics. You can still grow, make and consume food, but it will only restore health.

Planter and Kitchen blocks are made functional and allows to grow and cook food respectively.
Bar counter blocks are made functional as containers for consumables and food products.
Wheat, Soya, Vegetables, Apple, Mushroom and Herb farm blocks are added. Thanks Kuvat for awesome models!
Custom Kitchen reskin is added. This allows to use the mod without DLC.

No Script version is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2640914065]available[/url], without integration with ESDR stat mechanics.

[h1]How to make food[/h1]

Mine Grass on Earth/Alien/Pertam/Teal planets to get organics.
Hunt Wolves/Spiders to get meat.
Search Unknown Signal drops and Economy stations for wheat, apples, etc to use them as a seed to grow more.
Build Planters or Farming blocks to grow food. They work in the same way as Assemblers. See what items you need and put those to the block inventory (i.e. Ice, Organics, etc).
Build either one of the Kitchen blocks to make food out of ingredients. These blocks also works like Assembler.
You can sell raw food products in Economy stations. This gives a reason to farm and hunt more than you need to survive.
